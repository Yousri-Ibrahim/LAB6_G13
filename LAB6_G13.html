                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
                    Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic illness in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are strange (poorly differentiated). Anthracycline and cytarabine are standard chemotherapy for AML however their extreme side effects made a need to build up a targeted therapy. Malignant  cells could be targeted by ligands, antibodies or aptamers targeted drug delivery systems. Utilizing  small oligonucleotides to decline or silence specific genes (i.e. called antisense treatment) could be useful in treating AML. In this investigation; Gold nanoparticles utilized as vector for conveying antisense oligonucleotides(AOs) which target five imperative oncogenes e.g. BAG1, MDM2, BCL-2, BIRC5 and XIAP and against CD33(4)/CD34(5) as an aptamer for focusing on (HSC).

                    <h3>Methodology</h3>

<br>
                    The arrangement of mRNA of every gene was gotten from NCBI database and by help of oligo-work software; best AOs are picked. After that a poly A sequence was added between each AO sequence to create poly A-SH.  Synthesis of gold nanoparticles was finished by the assistance of ascorbic acid  after that it blended with poly A-SH to create poly A modified  gold nanoparticles and aptamer was included as the last advance. Preparation of cells suspension; AML patient's blood test were centrifuged and after that the middle  layer was taken (the cancerous  cells). That layer was been tested against three grouping of functionalized gold nanoparticles (FGNs), naked  gold nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles functionalized with a scrambled oligonucleotide (GNFSONs) and doxorubicin. Cells viability was been estimated by MTT assay [(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide )  assay]. 
                    RNA strands was isolated by utilizing RNX- Plus buffer and NanoDrop products which used in measuring optical density of isolated RNA. By mixing total RNA with random hexamer,  a cDNA was produced.
                    That cDNA was entered into a real-time PCR machine and the threshold
                    cycle (CT) of each gene was gotten and each gene expression ratio was calculated.

                    <h3>Results</h3>
<br>
                    Cells death is directly proportional to concentration of FGNs . i.e. the higher the concentration, the lower cells viability. At a similar concentration, FGNs has higher cells death than naked  gold nanoparticles and GNFSON. The contrast amongst FGNs and doxorubicin that FGNs had a more grounded impact than doxorubicin on gene expression. NGNs and GNFSONs were able  to silence genes only at higher concentration  was utilized.
